# Password-Generator

# A project used for creating a random password fulfilling the general criteria of creating a secure password:
At least 1 uppercase letter (A-Z)
At least 1 lowercase letter (a-z)
At least 1 digit (0-9)
At least 1 special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()-_=+[]{}|;:'",.<>?/`~)
At least 8 characters long, up to 20 characters long

Feel free to use this code to generate your passwords.
If you are planning on using this for a product, I would appreciate if you mention my GitHub username "Wasabi-Whip" and give credit for my creation of the tool.
Have fun with the code!
